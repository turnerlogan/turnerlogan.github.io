            <h1>More About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="message">
          <p>I began my career in astrophysics as a student researcher for two years at the University of Northern Colorado
            with an emphasis in muon count fluctuation and characteristics of Proxima b. Wanting to pursue a more hands-on
            application of engineering, I transitioned into mechanical engineering in manufacturing. In additon, I concurrently
            pursued opportunities in defense contracting. As a contractor, I primarily specialized in systems engineering and
            project management across AI, aerospace, and psychological applications. Following these opportunities in defense,
            I began working as a program analyst for a small federal contracting firm. Wanting to return to space-based applications,
            I then became the lead systems engineer on three programs in addition to assisting on the project management and test and
            analysis teams. During my time in this position I focused on developing solar arrays. In a desire to gain a broader
            knowledge of the tools available for systems engineering and project managment, I transitioned to construction management
            as a project engineer primarily focusing on scheduling, engineering change cost tracking, and verification and validation
            of various process systems.
