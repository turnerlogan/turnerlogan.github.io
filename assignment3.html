      "Mochi, short for <em>mochigome</em>, is a Japanese dish made of pounded rice paste that contains
      sugar, water, japonica glutinous rice, and cornstarch as a base. While consumed throughout
       the year, this dessert is traditionally associated with Japanese New Year celebrations. It
        is often found in a ball shape and can contain various fillings such as ice cream."

      "Believed to date back to ancient China, this process of steaming glutinous rice and shaping
      it into what has come to be known as mochi arrived in Japan around 300 BC. Throughout the Nara
       and Shinto periods, mochi was included in myths and celebrations, especially those of marriage
        and childbirth. Mochi was later associated with the New Year in the Helan period, where samurai
         would decorate the stacked mochi and use them in their altars to pray for prosperity."

      "Composed of the polysaccharides amylose and amylopectin, the large ratio of amylopectin over amylose
       gives glutinous rice its sticky characteristics, whereas nongluninous rice has a more even ratio of the
        two D-glucose units."

      "Mochi is prepared by steaming short-grain rice then mashing it into a paste. Once it is stirred
       into a ball, the mochi is cut into the desired shape and either filled or not. While there are
       differences between traditional and modern large-scale production, the overall process has remained
       largely unchanged throughout history."

      "Since the mochi base is unflavored rice, it is incredibly versality when flavoring is added. Common
      uses include confectionary, ice cream, and soup. The mochi can also be filled or remain unfilled, with
      flavors such as red bean paste or even entire strawberries on the sweet side of fillings."
